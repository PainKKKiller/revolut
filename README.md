home task for revolunt 

Live demo available here https://painkkkiller.github.io/revolut/

FX rates are provided by free plan of https://openexchangerates.org/. It includes 1000 requests per month and only USD as base currency. 

Conversion between currencies in application has done with money.js library.

Although task required polling FX provider for every 10 seconds, in published app this code commented out because I afraid it would  quickly waste all my free requests.
Feel free to uncomment and test this functionality.




Feel free to ask me about anything related to this project.
